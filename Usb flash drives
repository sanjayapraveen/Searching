Sanjay is trying to save a large file to a USB flash drive. He has n USB flash drives with capacities equal to a 1, a 2, ..., a n megabytes. The file size is equal to m megabytes.
Find the minimum number of USB flash drives needed to write Sanjay's file, if he can split the file between drives.
Input
The first line contains positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of USB flash drives.

The second line contains positive integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 105) — the size of Sean's file.

Each of the next n lines contains positive integer a i (1 ≤ a i ≤ 1000) — the sizes of USB flash drives in megabytes.

It is guaranteed that the answer exists, i. e. the sum of all a i is not less than m.

Output
Print the minimum number of USB flash drives to write Sean's file, if he can split the file between drives.
Sample input:
3
5
2
1
3
Samle output:
2

Code:
n = int(input())
 
arrayDrives = []
 
m = int(input())
 
for i in range(n):
	ai = int(input())
	arrayDrives.append(ai)
 
numberOfDrives = 0
totalSpace = 0
while totalSpace < m:
	numberOfDrives += 1
	totalSpace += max(arrayDrives)
	arrayDrives.remove(max(arrayDrives))
 
print("%d" % (numberOfDrives))
