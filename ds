Richard Hendricks, the famous CEO of Pied Piper from the show Silicon Valley has an unsual problem. He sits along with Gilfoyle and Dinesh, his code buddies and fellow co-founders of Pied Piper, to solve this so called "unsual" problem.


Richard Hendricks explains the problem to Gilfoyle and Dinesh and here is an excerpt from their conversation:


There have been several "Yes" or "No" messages in our chatting platform and I was thinking if we could possibly repesent this information in a shorter manner as we are basically a company that rose to fame for our very effective compression algorithm. Hence, I tried to represent the Yes messages by one and No messages by zero and the resulting representation was smaller, but could be much more efficiently represented. I specifically want a 4 fold decrease in the number of symbols (the number of characters in the previous case it was ones and zeros, but now it can be anything).

Gilfoyle jumps out saying that the base of the representation can be changed such a way that the ones and zeros can be mapped onto a different base that's takes 4 times lesser characters than the existing base. Help Gilfoyle defend his case.

Input Format : single line, containing a string made up of 0's and 1's

Input Constraints : 1<= N <= 57, where N is the number of characters (0's and 1's) in the string.

Output Format : Single line denoting the value of the binary string in a base that uses 4 times lesser characters than the existing base.

Sample Input :

10110111000010010011011001010111111000111010010010000
Sample Output :

16e126cafc7490

Code:
a=input()
b=int(a,2)
print(hex(b)[2:])
