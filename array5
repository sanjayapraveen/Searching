Petr stands in line of n people, but he doesn't know exactly which position he occupies. He can say that there are no less than a people standing in front of him and no more than b people standing behind him. Find the number of different positions Petr can occupy.

Input
The only line contains three integers n, a and b (0 ≤ a, b < n ≤ 100).

Output
Print the single number — the number of the sought positions.

Sample input:
3 1 1
Sample output:
2

Code:
n,a,b = input().split()
n = int(n)
a = int(a)
b = int(b)
print(n+1-max(a+1,n-b))
