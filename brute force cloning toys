Saran likes his toy a lot.Recently, he found a machine that can clone plush toys. Saran knows that if he applies the machine to an original toy, he additionally gets one more original toy and one copy, and if he applies the machine to a copied toy, he gets two additional copies.

Initially, Saran has only one original toy. He wants to know if it is possible to use machine to get exactly x copied toys and y original toys? He can't throw toys away, and he can't apply the machine to a copy if he doesn't currently have any copies.

Input
The only line contains two integers x and y (0 ≤ x, y ≤ 109) — the number of copies and the number of original toys Saran wants to get (including the initial one).

Output
Print "Yes", if the desired configuration is possible, and "No" otherwise.

Sample input:
6 3

Sample output:
Yes

Input2:
4 2
Output:
No

Code:
x,y=map(int, input().split())
print(['No','Yes'][x+2>y>0 and (x-y)%2])
