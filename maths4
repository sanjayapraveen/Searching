You are given a positive integer x. Find any such 2 positive integers a and b such that GCD(a,b)+LCM(a,b)=x.

As a reminder, GCD(a,b) is the greatest integer that divides both a and b. Similarly, LCM(a,b) is the smallest integer such that both a and b divide it.

It's guaranteed that the solution always exists. If there are several such pairs (a,b), you can output any of them.

Input
The first line contains a single integer t (1≤t≤100)  — the number of testcases.

Each testcase consists of one line containing a single integer, x (2≤x≤109).

Output
For each testcase, output a pair of positive integers a and b (1≤a,b≤109) such that GCD(a,b)+LCM(a,b)=x. It's guaranteed that the solution always exists. If there are several such pairs (a,b), you can output any of them.
