As you could know there are no male planes nor female planes. However, each plane on Earth likes some other plane. There are n planes on Earth, numbered from 1 to n, and the plane with number i likes the plane with number f i, where 1 ≤ f i ≤ n and f i ≠ i.

We call a love triangle a situation in which plane A likes plane B, plane B likes plane C and plane C likes plane A. Find out if there is any love triangle on Earth.

Input
The first line contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 5000) — the number of planes.

The second line contains n integers f 1, f 2, ..., f n (1 ≤ f i ≤ n, f i ≠ i), meaning that the i-th plane likes the f i-th.

Output
Output «YES» if there is a love triangle consisting of planes on Earth. Otherwise, output «NO».

You can output any letter in lower case or in upper case.

Sample input:
5
2 4 5 1 3
Sample output:
YES

Code:
n = int(input())
f = list(map(int, input().split()))
for i in range(n):
    a = i
    b = f[i] - 1
    c = f[b] - 1
    d = f[c] - 1
    if d == a and a != b and b != c and c != d:
        print("YES")
        exit()
print("NO")
