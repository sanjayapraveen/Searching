Sanjay is a Stock Exchange Specialist. Any stocks that he buys, he has a capacity of for such greater price. He has created a algorithm to find the profit that can be obtained by trading certain stocks. 
The machines will be generating a string, the string will be made up of integers from 0 to 9. Now each integer in this string will be a coded value of the profit. You have to multiply a digit N, with 
n-1,n-2,...till n-i>=1. Each digit in the string will be giving a profit of the particular amount thus obtained. Now summing up all the profits, it should be equal to the entire string considered as a 
integer input.


If they are equal, then the prediction was right, so print Right, if else print Wrong.

Input Format : One single string input N, where N is the prediction by Victor

Input Constraints : 1<=length of N<=10^5

Output Format : "Right" if the prediction is right and "Wrong" if the prediction is wrong

Input :
40583

Output :
Wrong

Code:
n= int(input())
sum = 0
temp = n
while(n):
    i = 1
    fact = 1
    rem = n % 10
    while(i <= rem):
        fact = fact * i
        i = i + 1
    sum = sum + fact
    n = int(n / 10)
if(sum == temp):
    print("Right")
else:
    print("Wrong")
