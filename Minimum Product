You are given four integers a, b, x and y. Initially, a≥x and b≥y. You can do the following operation no more than n times:

Choose either a or b and decrease it by one. However, as a result of this operation, value of a cannot become less than x, and value of b cannot become less than y.
Your task is to find the minimum possible product of a and b (a⋅b) you can achieve by applying the given operation no more than n times.

You have to answer t independent test cases.

Input
The first line of the input contains one integer t (1≤t≤2⋅104) — the number of test cases. Then t test cases follow.

The only line of the test case contains five integers a, b, x, y and n (1≤a,b,x,y,n≤109). Additional constraint on the input: a≥x and b≥y always holds.

Output
For each test case, print one integer: the minimum possible product of a and b (a⋅b) you can achieve by applying the given operation no more than n times.
Code:
for s in[*open(0)][1:]:a,b,x,y,n=map(int,s.split());c=min(n,a-x);d=min(n,b-y);print(min((a-c)*max(y,b-n+c),(b-d)*max(x,a-n+d)))
