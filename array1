Shovels and Swords
Polycarp plays a well-known computer game (we won't mention its name). In this game, he can craft tools of two types — shovels and swords. To craft a shovel, Polycarp spends two sticks and one diamond; to craft a sword, Polycarp spends two diamonds and one stick.

Each tool can be sold for exactly one emerald. How many emeralds can Polycarp earn, if he has a sticks and b diamonds?

Input
The first line contains one integer t (1≤t≤1000) — the number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (0≤a,b≤109) — the number of sticks and the number of diamonds, respectively.

Output
For each test case print one integer — the maximum number of emeralds Polycarp can earn.
