You are given two positive integers a and b. In one move you can increase a by 1 (replace a with a+1). Your task is to find the minimum number of moves you need to do in order to make a divisible by b. It is possible, that you have to make 0 moves, as a is already divisible by b. You have to answer t independent test cases.

Input
The first line of the input contains one integer t (1≤t≤104) — the number of test cases. Then t test cases follow.

The only line of the test case contains two integers a and b (1≤a,b≤109).

Output
For each test case print the answer — the minimum number of moves you need to do in order to make a divisible by b.
Sample input:
2

Sample output:
I hate that I love it

Code:
#include <stdio.h>
 
int main() {
    int n;
    scanf("%d", &n);
    for(int i = 1; i <= n; i++){
        if(i%2){
            printf ("I hate ");
        }
        else{
            printf ("I love ");
        }
        if(i == n){
            printf ("it\n");
        }
        else{
            printf ("that ");
        }
    }
    return 0;
}
