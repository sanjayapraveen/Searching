It seems like the year of 2013 came only yesterday. Do you know a curious fact? The year of 2013 is the first year after the old 1987 with only distinct digits.

Now you are suggested to solve the following problem: given a year number, find the minimum year number which is strictly larger than the given one and has only distinct digits.

Input
The single line contains integer y (1000 ≤ y ≤ 9000) — the year number.

Output
Print a single integer — the minimum year number that is strictly larger than y and all it's digits are distinct. It is guaranteed that the answer exists.

Sample input:
1987
Sample output:
2013

Code:
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
bool mark[10];
bool disdig (int x) {
    while (x > 0) {
        if (mark[x%10]) {
            return false;
        }
        else {
            mark[x%10] = true;
        }
        x /= 10;
    }
    return true;
}
int main() {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    int ans = 0;
    while (ans == 0) {
        n ++;
        if (disdig (n)) {
            ans = n;
        }
        for ( int i = 0 ; i < 10 ; i ++ ) {
            mark[i] = false;
        }
    }
    cout << ans;
    return 0;
}
