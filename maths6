One way to create a task is to learn from math. You can generate some random math statement or modify some theorems to get something new and build a new task from that.

For example, there is a statement called the "Goldbach's conjecture". It says: "each even number no less than four can be expressed as the sum of two primes". Let's modify it. How about a statement like that: "each integer no less than 12 can be expressed as the sum of two composite numbers." Not like the Goldbach's conjecture, I can prove this theorem.

You are given an integer n no less than 12, express it as a sum of two composite numbers.

Input
The only line contains an integer n (12 ≤ n ≤ 106).

Output
Output two composite integers x and y (1 < x, y < n) such that x + y = n. If there are multiple solutions, you can output any of them.

Sample input:
12
Sample output:
4 8

Code:
n = int(input())
if n%2==0:
    print(n-8, '8')
else:
    print(n-9,'9')
