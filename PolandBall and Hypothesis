PolandBall is a young, clever Ball. He is interested in prime numbers. He has stated a following hypothesis: "There exists such a positive integer n that for each positive integer m number n·m + 1 is a prime number".

Unfortunately, PolandBall is not experienced yet and doesn't know that his hypothesis is incorrect. Could you prove it wrong? Write a program that finds a counterexample for any n.

Input
The only number in the input is n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — number from the PolandBall's hypothesis.

Output
Output such m that n·m + 1 is not a prime number. Your answer will be considered correct if you output any suitable m such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 103. It is guaranteed the the answer exists.

Sample input:
4
Sample output:
2

A prime number (or a prime) is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.4·1 + 1 = 5. We cannot output 1 because 5 is prime. However, m = 2 is okay since 4·2 + 1 = 9, which is not a prime number.

Code:
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#define endl '\n'
#define mod 1000000007 // (= 10^9+7)
#define unsync ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0); cin.tie(0); cout.tie(0)
#define watch(x) cout << (#x) << " is " << (x) << endl
using namespace std;
bool isPrime(int n)
{
	for (int i = 2; i <= sqrt(n); ++i)
	{
		if(n%i == 0)
			return 0;
	}
	return 1;
}
int nxt()
{
	int x;
	cin >> x;
	return x;
}
 
 
int main()
{
	unsync;
	int a = nxt();
	if(a == 1) cout << 51;
	else if(a&1) cout << 1;
	else{
		bool ok = 0;
		int j=1, num;
		do{
			num = a*j+1;
			//watch(num);
			ok = isPrime(num);
			j++;
		}while(ok);
		cout << j-1;
	}
 
	
 
 
	cerr << "Time taken : " << 1.0 * clock() / CLOCKS_PER_SEC << " seconds." << endl;
	return 0;
}
