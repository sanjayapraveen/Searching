An Internet Protocol Version 6 address (IPv6 address) is a numerical label that is used to identify a network interface of a computer or a network node participating in an IPv6 computer network and for locating it in the network. IP addresses are transmitted in the fields of the packet header to indicate the source and the destination of each network packet. The IP address of the destination address is used to make decisions about routing IP packets to other networks.


IPv6 is the successor to the first addressing infrastructure of the Internet, Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4). In contrast to IPv4, which defined an IP address as a 32-bit value, IPv6 addresses have a size of 128 bits. Therefore, IPv6 has a vastly enlarged address space compared to IPv4. [wiki]


It is often very difficult to read 128 bits and hence IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force) decided to represent the 128 bits into 8 groups each containing 4 digits each for enhancing readability. However, computers transfer data in digital format in the physical layer. So write a code that converts a stream of digits in user readable form to the format that computers can understand and transmit. For simplicity assume that there are no colons that separate each group.

Input Format : Single line containing a stream of digits in user readable form

Input Constraints : 1<= N <= 15, where N is the length of the stream of digits in user readable form.

Output Format : Single line containing the string in the format that computers can understand and transmit.

Sample Input :

2
Sample Output :

10

Sample Input :

code:
print(str(bin(int(input(),16)))[2:])
